From a very young age I have been interested in technologies, how cool and amazing they are. While playing video games I always wondered how they were made and how incredible it would be if I were able to create them. That passion stayed with me and drives me to continue to be a part of the tech industry as a software engineer.</p>\n           <p>\n           Being able to create programs, small games and be involved with other software engineer is an experience to which I am grateful for. Currently I am working on a Swift personal project to further familiarize myself with SwiftUI and apple new programing paradigm. \n           When I am not banging my head on the keyboard or talking to rubber ducky, I love spending time cooking and being with my family.\n           </p>\n           <Link to=\"/\">Home</Link>\n        </main>\n       </Layout>\n\n    )\n}\n\nexport default about\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
