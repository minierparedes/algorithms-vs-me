Not having this knowledge will lead to misunderstandings or incorrectly understanding what a program’s code does, this leads to misinterpretation of the code and being unable to implemented.</p>\n<p>When one has a strong foundation in programming fundamentals, data structure and algorithms fundamentals, you are equipped to tackle programming problems and the challenges with a great sense of how to approach the problem and how to go about getting to the solution. However, if programming foundations are deficient, then attempting to solve programming problems can lead a lot of frustration and for the solution having errors. If there is deficiency in code reading skills and code writing skills, numerous syntax errors will be made when trying to write the solutions to the coding challenge. If there is deficiency in code reading skills and code writing skills, it is likely that the solution to the Programming challenge will also have a lot of logical errors.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h4>source</h4>\n<h6><a href=\"https://thelearningprogrammer.com/how-introductory-computer-programming-should-be-taught/\">-The Learning Programmer</a></h6>","frontmatter":{"title":"Deficient code knowledge","date":"22 December, 2020"},"fields":{"readingTime":{"text":"2 min read"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/heros-journey/deficient-code-knowledge/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
