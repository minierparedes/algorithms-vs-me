## A hero's Journey

This is my journey to mastering data structures and algorithms, both for myself,
helpinng further develop my coding and analitical skills, as well as for being able to have an opportunity at
**cracking the coding interview**. I plan to record my daily grid, working with
LeetCode and its platform of coding challenges.

The materials and resources I will be using are: 

-[**SeanPrashad LeetCode patterns**](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)
-[**Grokking the Coding Interview**](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-coding-interview)
-[**Udemy Mastering DSA**](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/)



## Sean Prashad LeetCode Patterns

A list of the best LeetCode questions that teach you core concepts and techniques 
for each category/type of problems. His list is for any individual wanting to 
improve their problem solving skills for software engineering interviews.
Problems are grouped under their respective subtopic, in order to focus on repeatedly 
applying common patterns rather than randomly tackling questions.
All questions are available on [**LeetCode**](https://leetcode.com)



## Grokking the Coding Interview: Patterns for Coding Questions

The site is dedicated to help give:
> the ability to map a new problem to an already known problem.

They help candidates with that, we've come up with a list of 16 patterns for coding questions, based 
on similarities in the techniques needed to solve them. As a result, once you're familiar with a 
pattern, you'll be able to solve dozens of problems with it. 


## JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Masterclas

A Udemy course by Colt Steele on teaching you how to analyze your codeâ€™s time and space complexity 
using **Big O** notation.  We cover the ins and outs of **Recursion**.  We learn a 5-step approach to 
solving any difficult coding problem. We cover common programming patterns. We implement popular 
**searching algorithms**.


## Master Algorithms and Data Structure through delibarate practice

Delibarate practice is: 
> Special type of practice that is purposeful and systematic. 


deliberate practice, is the opposite of some regular practice, that is just mindlessly doing the 
same repetitions, it's being conscience about your practice and concentration on the task at hand. 
Focusing on practice that becomes much more difficult and extends your abilities.

Delibarate practice was researched by Psychologist [K. Anders Ericsson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Anders_Ericsson), a professor of Psychology 
at Florida State University
